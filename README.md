Identifying Glitches in Gravitational Waves and Classifying them

Title: Identify Glitches in Gravitational Waves

Problem Statement: Gravitational wave data analysis is the study of identifying non Gaussian noise transients known as ‘Glitches’. A high occurrence rate of glitches in data can mimic or hazard true gravitational wave signals. Hence successful classification of glitches is an important part of gravitational wave analysis. The objective of this project is to classify the types of glitches in gravitational wave data. 

 
Tasks: Identify potential features of glitches in order to identify the type of glitches e.f., scattered light. Design novel feature selection framework or use the existing techniques with proper justifications to identify salient features of the given data. Report the performance of different classification techniques on the training data to demonstrate that the proposed feature selection scheme is working well. Subsequently, execute the best framework on the test data and submit the class labels in a text file. Each row of the text file will contain the class label of an instance of the test data e.g., scattered light following the order of the given test data.
